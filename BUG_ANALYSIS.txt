// Fixed roulette.js money calculation bug
// 
// BUG: Money wasn't tallying correctly because:
// 1. Bets were deducted when placed (line ~105)
// 2. clearBets() refunded all bets (line ~131)
// 3. But clearBets() is called AFTER adding winnings (line ~163)
//    This caused the player to get their bet back even when they lost!
//
// SOLUTION: Only refund bets in clearBets() if explicitly cleared by user,
//           not after every spin.

// The fix is to separate "clear bets for new round" from "refund bets"
