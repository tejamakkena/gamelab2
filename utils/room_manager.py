"""Shared room + player state for the native iOS/tvOS hub.

Every one of the 17 browser games re-implements this from scratch with its own
module-level ``<game>_rooms = {}`` dict and its own ``generate_room_code()``.
This is the single implementation the native hub uses instead.

Two design points worth stating up front:

1.  **The TV is never in ``players``.** It lives in ``tv_sids`` and is joined to
    the Socket.IO room, so it receives every broadcast without appearing in the
    lobby roster or counting toward the minimum-player gate.

2.  **``to_json()`` emits Swift key names exactly.** The client decodes with a
    default ``JSONDecoder`` (no snake_case conversion), so ``isReady`` and
    ``gameID`` are spelled that way here. A mismatch does not raise -- it makes
    the whole payload decode to nil and the screen silently never updates.
