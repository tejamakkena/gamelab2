"""Everything that pushes state out to the TV and the phones.

Modeled on the cleanest pattern already in the repo -- poker's per-player deal
loop (games/poker/socket_events.py:104) -- generalised so every engine gets the
same public/private split for free.

Two rules hold throughout:

*   Every emit passes ``namespace='/native'``. ``socketio.emit`` defaults to
    ``'/'``, and an emit to the wrong namespace fails silently.
*   Payloads are built under ``room.lock`` and emitted outside it. Socket writes
    can block, and holding the room lock across one would stall every handler.
