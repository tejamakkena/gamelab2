    client that only ever sees "the value at index 0 became 0 and the value
    at index 3 changed" cannot tell a tile *sliding* from column 0 to column
    3 apart from a merge or a fresh spawn happening to land on 3, which is
    exactly why the TV board used to just snap to each new grid of numbers
    instead of sliding tiles.

    ``tile_ids`` is a parallel array (same shape as ``boards``, 0 meaning
    "no tile") giving each occupied cell a stable id that survives a slide
    and is carried by the surviving tile through a merge, so a client that
    keeps the id from one push to the next can animate the actual movement
    instead of guessing at it. ``last_move_merged``/``last_move_spawned``
