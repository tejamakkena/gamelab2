"""The game-engine plugin contract.

An engine is pure game logic. It never touches a socket and never sleeps -- it
mutates its own state and lets the broadcaster publish. That keeps every engine
unit-testable without an app context or a socket connection.

All six required methods are called with ``room.lock`` already held by the
caller, so implementations must not re-acquire it and must not block.
