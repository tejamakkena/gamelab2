/// Siri Remote actually invoke a game card's action on the game-selection
/// screen at all?
///
/// This deliberately tests nothing else -- it only checks "does pressing
/// this remote button invoke the button's/command's closure" -- but it
/// genuinely cannot assume the app stays on the selection screen while
/// checking that anymore. It was originally written assuming exactly that
/// ("no real navigation past the selection screen ... no backend runs in
/// CI"), which was true for as long as a since-fixed bug (see PR #73) meant
/// `create_room`'s response never actually reached anything listening for
/// it. Now that it does, this test's own presses reach the real, live
/// server configured in AppConstants.serverURL and can flip the screen
/// straight to the lobby before either test ever gets to check for the
/// `debugLastInput` diagnostic in TVGameSelectionView (compiled in only for
/// `#if DEBUG` builds, which is what this test target -- and every other
/// Simulator build in this repo -- runs as) -- confirmed directly from a
/// real CI failure log: `gameCard_trivia` had vanished and the visible
/// hierarchy showed a `Button, label: 'Waiting for 2 more…'` -- TVLobbyView,
/// not a broken press. `pressAndExpectDebugLabel` below treats either
/// signal (the banner, or the whole selection screen navigating away) as
/// equally valid proof the press reached `pick(_:)`.
