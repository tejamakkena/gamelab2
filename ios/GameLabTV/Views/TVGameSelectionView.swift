    // code and no controller access at all, and Atlas -- whose only input

    // GameLabTVUITests doesn't need to reproduce an exact D-pad navigation
    // sequence just to reach a card before pressing Select.
    //
    // Deliberately NOT using .prefersDefaultFocus(_:in:): the first attempt
    // at this used exactly that, and GameLabTVUITests' own first real CI run
    // showed Select/Play-Pause never reaching pick(_:) at all -- consistent
    // with a known tvOS gotcha where .prefersDefaultFocus racing a LazyVGrid's
    // own child layout can silently lose to whatever non-lazy view (here, the
    // sidebar's "All" pill) is already laid out by the time the focus engine
    // resolves an initial target. Setting the existing, already-working
    // $focusedGame binding directly (below, on .onAppear) sidesteps that
    // race entirely -- it's the same binding swipe navigation already uses
    // successfully, just assigned imperatively instead of declaratively.
    // GameLabTVUITests keeps its own defensive hasFocus check + Right-press
    // fallback regardless, so a future regression here fails loudly there
    // with a clear message instead of silently pressing the wrong element.

    // TEMPORARY diagnostic: four different Select-click mechanisms have each
    // been reported as "still doesn't do anything" on real hardware, with no
    // way from here to tell whether the input is reaching `pick(_:)` at all
    // or whether it fires but something after it (onSelect/onSelectSolo ->
    // the socket round-trip -> the screen transition) is what's silent. This
    // makes that unambiguous with a full-screen flash + label the instant
    // pick(_:) runs, before any of that downstream logic -- independent of
    // TVGameCard's own focus styling, which was a red herring earlier: a
    // Button's default focus chrome is a FOCUS effect, not proof a click
    // fired. Remove this whole block once the real cause is confirmed.

/// The motion budget is spent deliberately, and only on the focused card:

///   * Unfocused cards are completely still. Every continuous effect below is

///     be visual noise on a TV and a pointless GPU load on an Apple TV, and
///     `LazyVGrid` keeps offscreen ones from existing at all.
///   * Exactly one card is focusable at a time, so at most one card is ever
///     running these four cheap, GPU-friendly effects: an emoji float, a
///     breathing ring/glow, a diagonal sheen sweep, and a slow 3D sway.
///   * No `Timer` anywhere -- everything is a SwiftUI `repeatForever`
///     animation, so it stops with the view and costs nothing when idle.
